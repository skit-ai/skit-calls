# skit-calls

Skit.ai's calls library.

We provide means to sample calls, and conversations (aka turns) from a specified environment.
This data is required for analysis and training machine learning models. Hence the current offering
of this library is an aggregation of conversation over calls.

** Note: ** This repository is not expected for stand alone use.
We use this as a component within [skit-pipelines](https://github.com/skit-ai/skit-pipelines)

To contribute, you would require a virtual environment running python 3.10.
